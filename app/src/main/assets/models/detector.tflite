# This is a placeholder file for the detector.tflite model
# 
# To get a working model, you need to:
# 1. Collect training data (400-800 images of Klondike solitaire games)
# 2. Label the images with bounding boxes for:
#    - card_face_up
#    - card_back  
#    - pile_slot_tableau
#    - pile_slot_foundation
# 3. Train a YOLOv8 model or use Roboflow
# 4. Export as TFLite (int8 quantized)
# 5. Replace this file with the trained model
#
# See the README.md in this directory for detailed training instructions
